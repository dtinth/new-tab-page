# dtinth’s Chrome new tab page

## Features

When opening a new tab, I see a clock.

Scrolling down, I see the most recent tweets from a subset of my Twitter friends.
Since some friends tweet a lot while others occasionally, I made it so that it displays at most 1 latest tweet per person, so tweets by friends who don’t tweet a lot don’t get drowned.
